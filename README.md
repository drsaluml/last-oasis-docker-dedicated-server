# Last Oasis: Ubuntu Linux / Docker based dedicated server

**WARNING:** This is pretty much a WIP Proof of Concept. Use at **your own risk!**.

This repo might help you to run dedicated servers for [Last Oasis](https://lastoasis.gg/) on Linux and/or with docker.\
You should bring basic knowledge of Linux CLI in order to utilize what we got here.

## Installation

Download this repository either via git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/deradon/last-oasis-docker-dedicated-server
```

or via plain [download](https://github.com/Deradon/last-oasis-docker-dedicated-server/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Usage

You might utilize this tool with a plain Linux (tested with Ubuntu 20.04), `docker` or `docker-compose`:

### Ubuntu

* Requirements: [Downloading SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Linux)

#### Configure

Copy the example config file and adjust it to your needs:

```shell
# Get repo (@see Installation)
cp config.example config
```

It should look close to:

<details>
  <summary>Example config</summary>

    # Get it from https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/Settings ("Game server registration key")
    SERVER_CUSTOMER_KEY="XgZyB0HDYtv4JJ1tUUybXg"

    # Server name to use. Must be unique per server realm.
    SERVER_IDENTIFIER="Example Server"

    # How many slots the server should offer. (Default: "10")
    SERVER_SLOTS="25"

    # Eternal server ip to use.
    SERVER_IP_ADDRESS=233.252.0.98

    # Server port to use. Must be unique per server realm and IP.
    SERVER_PORT="62001"

    # Server query port to use. Must be unique per server realm and IP.
    SERVER_QUERY_PORT="27015"

    # Get it from https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/Settings ("Self hosted game servers registration keys")
    SERVER_PROVIDER_KEY="6fSIs5nTwnhfjcaVlZ5BmA"

    # Steam user name to login with.
    STEAM_USER="FancyAlice"
</details>

#### Install

When using the tool for the first time, steam ask you to login
and provide the 2FA code. That's because the Last Oasis server can not yet be downloaded
anonymously.

**IMPORTANT:** Whenever an unknown tool ask you for your password, check the source! Fight scamming and phishing!

```shell
./last-oasis install
```

#### Run

```shell
./last-oasis run
```

#### Backup

Create a tarball of the save data (`Mist/Saved/`) under `$INSTALL_DIR/backups`:

```shell
./last-oasis backup
```

Override the destination via the `BACKUP_DIR` env var.

#### Help

```shell
./last-oasis help
```

---

### Docker

* Requirements: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

#### Configure

Copy the example config file and adjust it to your needs:

```shell
# Get repo (@see Installation)
cp config.example config
```

It should look close to:

<details>
  <summary>Example config</summary>

    # Get it from https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/Settings ("Game server registration key")
    SERVER_CUSTOMER_KEY="XgZyB0HDYtv4JJ1tUUybXg"

    # Server name to use. Must be unique per server realm.
    SERVER_IDENTIFIER="Example Server"

    # How many slots the server should offer. (Default: "10")
    SERVER_SLOTS="25"

    # Eternal server ip to use.
    SERVER_IP_ADDRESS=233.252.0.98

    # Server port to use. Must be unique per server realm and IP.
    SERVER_PORT="62001"

    # Server query port to use. Must be unique per server realm and IP.
    SERVER_QUERY_PORT="27015"

    # Get it from https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/Settings ("Self hosted game servers registration keys")
    SERVER_PROVIDER_KEY="6fSIs5nTwnhfjcaVlZ5BmA"

    # Steam user name to login with.
    STEAM_USER="FancyAlice"
</details>

#### Install

When using the tool for the first time, steam ask you to login
and provide the 2FA code. That's because the Last Oasis server can not yet be downloaded
anonymously.

**IMPORTANT:** Whenever an unknown tool ask you for your password, check the source! Fight scamming and phishing!

```shell
./last-oasis-docker install
```

#### Run

```shell
./last-oasis-docker run
```

#### Logs

Tail the latest entries from `Mist.log` inside the volume:

```shell
./last-oasis-docker logs
```

#### Backup

Create a tarball of the save data into `./backups` on the host:

```shell
./last-oasis-docker backup
```

Override the destination via the `HOST_BACKUP_DIR` env var.

#### Help

```shell
./last-oasis-docker help
```

#### Pre-built image

A pre-built image is available on GitHub Container Registry — pull a
released version instead of building locally:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/drsaluml/last-oasis-docker-dedicated-server:latest
```

Tags follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (e.g. `1.2.3`, `1.2`, `latest`).

---

### Docker Compose

**WARNING** Experimental!

* Requirements: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Configure

Copy the example `docker-copose` file and adjust it to your needs:

```shell
# Get repo (@see Installation)
cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
```

**NOTE** Do NOT copy the `config.example` as this would overwrite your individual server configuration!

It should look close to:

<details>
  <summary>Example config</summary>

## Docker image releases

The Docker image is built and published to GitHub Container Registry by
[`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml)
**only when a SemVer tag is pushed** (`v1.2.3`).

To cut a new release:

```shell
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

The workflow will build and push three tags:

- `ghcr.io/drsaluml/last-oasis-docker-dedicated-server:1.2.3`
- `ghcr.io/drsaluml/last-oasis-docker-dedicated-server:1.2`
- `ghcr.io/drsaluml/last-oasis-docker-dedicated-server:latest`

The workflow can also be triggered manually via *Actions → Build and
publish Docker image → Run workflow*.

## Healthcheck

The Docker image ships with a Steam A2S query healthcheck that pings
the configured `SERVER_QUERY_PORT`. Containers running the `run`
command will be marked **unhealthy** if the server hangs but keeps the
process alive — pair this with `restart: always` (already set in the
compose template) so Docker will recycle a stuck server.
